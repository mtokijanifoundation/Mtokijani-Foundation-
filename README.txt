Mtokijani Foundation — Final website (Earth-tone theme) package

Files included:
- index.html (Home)
- about.html (About)
- donate.html (Donate + M-Pesa details)
- contact.html (Contact form uses Formspree - replace the action URL after setup)
- thankyou.html (Donation confirmation / thank you)
- assets/ (logo.png, hero.jpg, gallery1-8.jpg) -- placeholders, replace with real images

Important setup steps:
1. Replace assets/logo.png with your official logo file (same name) to have the real logo on the site.
2. (Recommended) Register a free Formspree form to receive messages to mtokijani**foundation@gmail.com**:
   - Go to https://formspree.io and sign up.
   - Create a new form and copy the form endpoint (looks like https://formspree.io/f/xxxxxx).
   - Replace the action attribute in contact.html with your form endpoint, then commit the change.
3. Upload all files to your GitHub repository named: mtokijanifoundation.github.io
   - Commit changes and wait ~1-2 minutes. Your site will be live at: https://mtokijanifoundation.github.io
4. To make the Donate button more automated later, you can add a PayPal link or a simple donation confirmation flow.

If you want, I can replace assets/logo.png for you now if you upload the logo file (PNG preferred) — I'll rebuild and send the ZIP.
